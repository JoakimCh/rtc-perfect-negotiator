Just some super elegant code to make the WebRTC API more enjoyable to work with.

## My philosophy:

Here you will se no TypeScript, no Tailwind, no React, no compilation steps whatsoever!

Only lean and mean, modern and bloat free code designed with the tiniest API's possible! (my own)

> A great programmer writes the smallest amount of code and has the smallest amount of mess in their project!

Modern JS / frontend programming is a disgrace!!!
