Just some super elegant code to make the WebRTC API more enjoyable to work with.

## My thoughts about the WebRTC API:

It's a completely retarded API which forces the poor frontend developers to implement the most important parts themselves.

With my `RTCPerfectNegotiator` though we only need to operate a signaling channel to the remote peer and the negotiator will handle the rest.

But I see no reason why the official API shouldn't also just work like that...

> Basically my code de-tards or un-tards the API.

## My philosophy on JS coding:

Here you will se no TypeScript, no Tailwind, no React, no compilation steps whatsoever!

Only lean and mean, modern and bloat free code designed with the tiniest API's possible! (my own)

> A great programmer writes the smallest amount of code and has the smallest amount of mess in their project!

Modern JS / frontend programming is a disgrace!!! 

I refuse, I resist!  My code is art! ðŸ˜Ž  
Fuck your over-complicated mess!
